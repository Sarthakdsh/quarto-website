Utilizing the temperature dependence of silicon’s absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, wafer temperature can be obtained from the measured transmitted power. Accurate temperature measurements over a wide range require multiple laser sources with different wavelengths, increasing the system’s complexity and reducing acquisition speed, due to the requirement of switching between multiple lasers. The system can be simplified by replacing multiple lasers with a single supercontinuum source. The measurement accuracy in the lower temperature range is poor, using a spectrally flat supercontinuum. We propose the use of a compact, cost-effective telecom fiber-based supercontinuum source whose spectrum can be tailored. We show that spectra having exponential roll-off towards longer wavelengths leads to improvement of the temperature measurement accuracy. We optimized the spectral shape to achieve enhanced measurement accuracy, with ∼1 °C accuracy from room temperature to 600 °C an improvement by a factor of &gt; 6x compared to a flat supercontinuum source. Additionally, the elimination of the need for inline optical switches enhances acquisition speed, which is currently limited only by the detector response time of ∼ 66 ms. The proposed method can easily be scaled for simultaneous temperature measurements at multiple spatial locations, enabled by high power availability from the supercontinuum source."

However, they are limited in terms of spectral purity where a small amount of output power resides in unwanted Stokes orders. This is due to the inherent intensity noise of pump source used for Raman conversion, which gets transferred and amplified to multiple Stokes orders. Since each Stoke’s signal acts as a pump for the next Stoke’s signal, spectral purity keeps reducing with increasing Stokes order. Further, this increases spectral broadening in these systems due to nonlinear effects of self-phase modulation (SPM) and Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM), thereby, limiting the narrow linewidth operation. Broad spectral width in CRFLs is attributed to 1) inherent broad (~40THz) Raman gain spectrum, and to 2) nonlinear spectral broadening through SPM and XPM. By employing narrow bandwidth spectral filters for feedback and low intensity noise sources for the pump, narrow linewidth operation can be achieved. Here, we demonstrate a low-intensity noise (&lt;-101dBc/Hz from 9kHz to 10GHz) CRFL with &lt;= 99% spectral purity over 6 Stokes orders. A low-intensity noise (&lt;-147dBc/Hz from 9kHz to 10GHz), Narrow linewidth (DBR, 5MHz) 1064nm laser as a pump source. It is line-broadened to ~50GHz bandwidth through phase modulation with a noise source and a sinusoidal signal to suppress stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). It is then amplified to 73W using amplifier chain and a passive Raman fiber of length 340m is used for Raman conversion. This work paves a way to achieve narrow linewidth CRFLs with very high conversion efficiency."

We have demonstrated a technique based on transmitted power measurement utilizing a spectrally shaped supercontinuum source, for temperature measurement in a wide range from room temperature to 7000C, with an accuracy of approximately 1 0C for the entire range of temperature measurement with an acquisition speed of milliseconds. It has been observed that shorter wavelengths show high absorption at lower temperatures, whereas longer wavelengths show high absorption at elevated temperatures, and vice versa. As a result, for spectra with exponential roll-off towards longer wavelengths, the transmitted power drops sharply as a function of wafer temperature. Hence, higher accuracy of measurement is possible, which is only limited by the intensity noise of the source. The intensity noise of the source is measured as 1.25%.

This is due to transfer of power from the pump to successive Stokes using cascaded Raman conversion. Frequency doubling the output of such widely tunable CRFLs can generate tunable visible lasers from green to red and beyond. But conventional CRFLs have broad linewidths due to the broad Raman gain, which limits the power and efficiency of nonlinear conversion to visible wavelengths. Only a fraction of NIR power is converted to visible, so linewidth control of the generated Stokes is desired. To address this issue, a custom feedback mechanism is used that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength. This mechanism allows for linewidth control of CRFLs up to the sixth order of Stokes shift and can potentially be extended further till approximately 2 μm, limited by loss and Zero Dispersion Wavelength (ZDWL) in Raman fiber. The result is significantly reduced linewidths from approximately 4-5 nm to &lt;1 nm along with multi-watt class output, as well as fine tuning of wavelength within the Stokes band using a fixed wavelength pump. As proof of concept, over 100 mW of visible power at 557 nm is generated through frequency doubling of the first Stokes along with wavelength tunability."

A wavelength-tunable pump combined with random distributed feedback makes the CRFLs wavelength agile. Broadband point feedback at one end reduces the threshold, leading to multiple cascaded shifts in manageable fiber lengths, generating output in the whole NIR region. Such tunable CRFL can be frequency doubled to obtain a continuously wavelength-tunable visible source. However, the output line widths of such tunable CRFLs are significantly broader than the phase-matching bandwidths of typical nonlinear crystals. Only a small fraction of NIR power is inside the phase-matching bandwidths, leading to poor conversion efficiency. Hence, linewidth reduction of CRFL output is crucial for efficient visible conversion. Using a dual feedback mechanism consisting of an all-wavelength flat plus a desired wavelength narrow feedback, a ∼5× reduction in output linewidths of CRFLs, with multi-watt output powers till six cascaded shifts are obtained without compromising the wavelength tunability of the system. The present work uses a wavelength tunable pump (1055nm to 1095nm) in a dual feedback-based CRFL, providing a linewidth-controlled output in any wavelength in the NIR region. Frequency doubling of the output is carried out to generate continuously tunable visible output from 527nm in green to 710nm in red with powers ∼70mW, with narrow spectral widths (&lt;0.1nm) and single-mode intensity distribution."

By utilizing an electro-optic comb generator that can adjust the repetition rate and central wavelength, this system generates numerous wavelengths from a single laser, serving as individual laser sources for spectral beam combining. Additionally, the system can incorporate a single line-broadener for all channels together for suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). A de-multiplexer is used to separate distinct wavelengths into individual fiber ports. By employing external phase modulation with white noise, the system can adjust the linewidth from a single frequency to 4 GHz. Furthermore, superior SBS control is achieved by tailoring the lineshape in the de-multiplexer, which reduces feedback-assisted SBS. With the customized lineshape, the SBS threshold of the system increases by &gt;50%. By mitigating the complexities of conventional spectral beam combining, such as the use of multiple laser sources and the requirement for each laser to have a current and temperature controller, in addition to a line broadener, this innovative approach presents a cost-effective and less complex alternative for power scaling."

    "text": "🤔 What is Raman fiber amplifier, and why simulate it?\nA Raman fiber amplifier (RFA) uses the Raman scattering effect to amplify optical signals directly within the transmission fiber itself. Unlike traditional fiber amplifiers that require special dopants in optical fiber, Raman scattering can turn any ordinary optical fiber into an amplifier, making RFAs incredibly versatile for telecommunications systems.\nHere are some of the points why RFAs are revolutionary:\n\nWavelength flexibility: Raman amplification can be done at any wavelength and in any conventional optical fiber.\nBroad bandwidth: Leads to amplification of large range of wavelengths, essential for dense wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems\nDistributed amplification: The entire fiber becomes the gain medium, providing amplification along the transmission path\n\nRFAs are now commonly used in long-haul communication systems that are designed to operate over thousands of kilometers. Simulating these RFAs is crucial, as complex nonlinear interactions between pump and signal beams makes analytical solutions impossible for a practical situation. By modeling the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) that govern Raman amplification, we can optimize several aspects of the amplifier design such as pump parameters, fiber lengths, and design systems before performing an expensive experimental validation. Also simulation provides us a handy tool to understand the workings of a system by varying only the desired parameter, which is not possible in a practical system. Now let’s discuss why Julia programming language is a good choice to do the simulation."

This is known as Raman scattering. Imagine a high energy photon (pump) that collide with vibrating fiber molecules (phonons), giving up some of their energy becoming a lower energy photon (Stokes) at lower frequency or longer wavelength (The pump photons can also receive energy from phonons leading to higher frequency anti-Stokes photons, but this is usually a weak process at room temperatures). If a signal photon is already present at Stokes frequency, it can lead to stimulated Raman scattering leading to amplification of the signal wave at Stokes frequency (and thus Raman gain).\n\n\nThe power-balance equation\nThe heart of Raman amplifier simulation lies in two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe how pump and signal (Stokes) powers evolve along the fiber [1] \\[\n\\begin{align} \\\\\n&\\mathbf{Signal\\ equation:}\n&\\frac{dP_{s}}{dz}&= g_{R}P_{p}P_{s} - \\alpha_{s}P_{s} \\\\\n&\\mathbf{Pump\\ equation:}\n&\\frac{dP_{p}}{dz}&= -\\frac{\\nu_{p}}{\\nu_{s} }g_{R}P_{p}P_{s} - \\alpha_{p}P_{p}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{1}\\] where:\n\n\\(P_{s}\\) and \\(P_{p}\\) are signal and pump powers that are a function of position \\(z\\)\n\\(g_{R}\\) is the Raman gain efficiency\n\\(\\alpha_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{p}\\) are signal and pump attenuation coefficients\n\\(\\nu_{s}\\) and \\(\\nu_{p}\\) are signal and pump frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram illustrating the power-balance equation\n\n\n\nThe \\(g_{R}P_{p}P_{s}\\) term is the power transfer from pump to signal due to stimulated Raman scattering and the term \\(-\\frac{\\nu_{p}}{\\nu_{s} }g_{R}P_{p}P_{s}\\) represents the power loss in the pump as it is transferred to signal. The reason of the \\(\\nu_{p}/\\nu_{s}\\) term is due to photon number conservation (in absence of loss) [1].\nThe power-balance equations describes the initial pump and signal power \\(P_{p}(0)\\) and \\(P_{s}(0)\\) evolves along the fiber length \\(L\\).\n\nKey assumptions\nThe above equations are derived with these assumptions\n\nCW or quasi-CW regime: both pump and signal assumed to be close to continuous-wave(CW) and so no time dependence is considered, valid assumption in most telecommunications applications.\nSingle-mode fiber: both pump and signal waves are in the fundamental mode of fiber, appropriate for standard telecom fibers\nCo-propagating: both pump and signal waves travel in the same direction, valid in most cases and simple to begin with simulation compared to the counter-propagating case.\nNo dispersion: the fiber has same mode solutions at both pump and signal waves, an assumption we can easily relax, considered initially only to simplify the simulation.\n\nThe beauty of these equations, under the given assumptions, lies in their simplicity — yet they capture the essential physics of energy transfer, amplification, and loss in fiber Raman amplifiers."

More on this will be discussed later.\nNow let’s import the necessary packages\n\nusing DifferentialEquations, Plots, LaTeXStrings, BenchmarkTools\n\n\n\nCoding the Physics\nLet’s implement our Raman amplifier simulation step by step:\n\nStep 1: Define the simulation parameters\n\n# ------- Signal parameters -------\nλs = 1550.0   # Signal wavelength (nm)  \nPs_0 = 1e-3   # Input signal power (W)       \n\n# ------- Pump parameters -------\nλp = 1450.0   # Pump wavelength (nm)\nPp_0 = 2.0      # Input pump power (W)         \n\n# ------- Fiber parameters -------\nα_p = 0.23     # Pump attenuation (dB/km)       \nα_s = 0.19     # Signal attenuation (dB/km)     \ngR = 0.4       # Raman gain efficiency (1/W/km)\nL = 50         # Length of fiber (km)\n\nThese parameters represent a typical telecommunications fiber Raman amplifier. The fiber parameters taken are for a standard single-mode fiber (SMF).\n\n\nStep 2: Set up the ODE system\n\nfunction Raman1!(dP, P, a, z)\n    Pp, Ps = P\n    r, α_p, α_s, gR = a\n\n    dP[1] = -α_p * Pp - r * gR * Pp * Ps # dPp/dz\n    dP[2] = -α_s * Ps + gR * Pp * Ps   # dPs/dz\nend\n\nThis function defines our ODE system in the form required by DifferentialEquations.jl. The ! indicates an in-place function that modifies dP directly — more efficient for large systems. Here \\(r\\) denotes the ratio of pump to signal frequency \\(r=\\nu_{p}/\\nu_{s}\\)\n\n\nStep 3: Configure and solve the ODE system\nFirst let’s define some convenience functions to convert loss from dB/km to 1/km unit and calculate frequency in THz when wavelength is given in nm.\n\n# ------- Convenience functions -------\nconst c = 299792.458;  # speed of light in nm THz\n1α_lin(dB::Real) = dB / (10 * log10(exp(1))) # convert loss from dB to linear\nget_ν(λ::Real) = c / λ # get frequency (THz) from wavelength (nm)\nto_dBm(P::Real) = 10 * log10(P * 1e3) # convert power from Watt to dBm\n\n\n1\n\nBy appending ::Real we are saying the function can take only real numbers like integers, floats, fractions …\n\n\n\n\nNow we configure the system and solve the ODE.\n\n# Initial conditions and span\nP0 = [Pp_0, Ps_0]\nzspan = (0.0, L)\n\n# parameters\na = (get_ν(λp)/get_ν(λs), α_lin(α_p), α_lin(α_s), gR) \n\n# create and solve ode problem\nprob = ODEProblem(Raman1!, P0, zspan, a) # creating the ODE problem\nsol = solve(prob,Tsit5(), saveat=L/1000) # solving the ODE problem\n\nWe use Tsit5(), a high-quality Runge-Kutta method that’s excellent for non-stiff problems. The saveat option ensures we get solutions at regular intervals for smooth plotting.\n\n\nStep 4: Visualize the results\n\nplot(sol.t, [to_dBm.(sol[1,:]), to_dBm.(sol[2,:])],\n    linewidth = 2,\n    xaxis=\"Length (km)\",\n    yaxis=\"Power (dBm)\",\n    label =[L\"P_p\" L\"P_s\"],\n    legendfontsize=14,\n    legend=:right,\n    margin=10Plots.mm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Power evolution of pump and signal along the fiber length.\n\n\n\n\nWith this, we’ve successfully simulated a Raman fiber amplifier using Julia. A signal at 1550 nm traveling in a standard SMF gets amplified over the length of the fiber due to Raman scattering. We just had to input 2 W of pump power at 1450 nm alongside the signal to achieve this effect."

After all, one of the key reasons for choosing Julia is its reputation for high-performance scientific computing.\nJulia provides a simple macro, @time, which gives a quick estimate of execution time. However, for more rigorous benchmarking, especially when comparing performance across implementations, we turn to the BenchmarkTools.jl package. It offers the @btime macro, which runs the code multiple times and reports the minimum execution time along with memory allocations.\nLet’s benchmark our solver:\n\n1@btime solve(prob,Tsit5(), save_everystep = false);\n\n\n1\n\nWe just want memory allocations done for solving the ODE and not for saving the values, hence save_everystep = false\n\n\n\n\n  16.000 μs (85 allocations: 4.59 KiB)\n\n\nThis result tells us that in executing the code in executing the code solve(prob,Tsit5(), save_everystep = false): - It took about 16 μs - It performs 85 heap allocations, consuming about 4.59 KiB of memory.\nHeap allocations refer to memory dynamically allocated during runtime. While necessary, excessive allocations can slow down performance. More on heap allocations can be found here and here. Fortunately, our current implementation is already quite efficient.\n\nWhy this code runs fast?\nAchieving this level of performance isn’t just about using Julia—it’s also about writing optimized code. In writing the code here, I have followed the guidelines of Code Optimization for Differential Equations.For an ODE solver, most of the time will be spent inside the function we are trying to solve. Here’s what I did to ensure our solver spends minimal time inside the ODE function.:\n\nThe core function Raman1! is written as an in-place function, which avoids unnecessary memory allocations.\nPre-computed values like the frequency ratio \\(\\nu_{p}/\\nu_{s}\\) and unit conversion of parameters outside the ODE function to reduce overhead.\nAdditionally, type stability is ensured (Can be checked using @code_typed Raman1!(similar(P0), P0, zspan, a))"

In Julia, regular arrays are heap-allocated, which means they involve dynamic memory management. For small arrays (like our 2-element power vector), this can be inefficient. Stack-allocated and immutable StaticArrays reduces heap allocations and speeds up computation.\nTo use StaticArrays, we need to make a few changes:\n\nUse SA[] instead of regular array constructors\n\nSA[] creates a SVector, a statically sized vector.\nExample: SA[dPp, dPs] returns a 2-element static vector.\n\nSwitch to an out-of-place function.\n\nOur original function Raman1! was in-place, meaning it modified an existing array.\nStaticArrays are immutable, so we return a new array instead—this is called an out-of-place function.\n\n\nHere’s the updated code:\n\nusing StaticArrays \nfunction Raman1_Static(P, a, z)\n    r, α_p, α_s, gR = a\n    Pp, Ps = P\n\n    dPp = -α_p * Pp - r * gR * Pp * Ps # dPp/dz\n    dPs = -α_s * Ps + gR * Pp * Ps   # dPs/dz\n    return SA[dPp, dPs]\nend\n\nP0 = SA[Pp_0, Ps_0];  # (pump , signal)power \na = SA[get_ν(λp)/get_ν(λs), α_lin(α_p), α_lin(α_s), gR];\n\nprob = ODEProblem(Raman1_Static, P0, zspan, a);\n@btime solve(prob, Tsit5(), save_everystep=false);\n\n  5.467 μs (25 allocations: 1.92 KiB)\n\n\nThat’s a 3x speedup with significantly fewer allocations — an impressive gain for such a small change.

In recent years, wavelength-tunable cascaded Raman lasers have been achieved using a Random Distributed Feedback Raman Fiber laser pumped in the 1micron wavelength band. Here, wavelength tuning is achieved using a combination of output power tuning for selecting different Stokes orders and tuning the wavelength of the pump source for output wavelength tuning around a specific Stokes order. In this approach, the feedback in the laser is broadband, and thus, the spectral purity and spectral linewidth of the output is severely compromised. There have been approaches to control the feedback using different filter architectures such as WDMs, Fabry-Perot filters, filter-fibers. Still, each has limitations in either the operating wavelength window or the spectral resolution. Here, we demonstrate a cascaded Raman laser comprising a reflective Fourier pulse shaper that provides near arbitrary feedback control. Our approach can enable wavelength and linewidth tunable lasers with a fixed wavelength pump. The pulse shaper operates over a wavelength region from 1.1 – 1.3micron, achieves spectral features as small as 0.5nm. The output of the cascaded Raman laser is over 10W, and the center wavelength can be selected from discrete lines at 1117nm, 1175nm, 1240nm with over 15nm of fine-tuning around each. The spectral purity of the output is &lt;95% in all cases. The linewidth of the output is reduced to sub-nm levels and can be continuously tuned from 1-4nm by pulse shaper settings."

Conventional CRFLs with broadband feedback are widely wavelength tunable but have broad line widths. A feedback mechanism must be used to reduce the broadening of the linewidth without compromising the wavelength tunability. Here, we propose to use a dual feedback mechanism that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths, using a flat cleave, with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength due to a grating filter. This allows substantial linewidth reduction of CRFLs up to the 6th Raman shifts, from 1100 nm to 1500 nm, and can be extended further. Significantly reduced linewidth with multi-watt in-band output power is achieved with fine wavelength tuning within each Raman Stokes band using a fixed wavelength pump. As an application of linewidth narrowed output, we performed frequency doubling of CRFL output to generate over 100 mW of wavelength tunable yellow-green and yellow output with enhanced efficiency."

Recently, random distributed feedback (RDFB), which provides broadband feedback, has shown to provide a great amount of wavelength tunability. Currently, coarse tuning in these lasers is achieved by controlling the Raman Stokes order through the power and feedback tuning, while fine-tuning within a Stokes order is achieved using a wavelength-tunable pump laser. Feedback tuning is achieved through simple filters such as short-pass filters to terminate the Raman cascade or a cascade of filters to enhance filtering complexity. In either approach, to achieve wavelength fine-tuning over several Raman Stokes orders, the system complexity is substantially enhanced. Here, we overcome this limitation by using a Fourier spectral shaper, a technique for achieving arbitrary spectral control to modify the feedback. A photolithographically fabricated 2-D mask in the shaper whose spatial co-ordinates can be altered together with the presence of multiple patterns on the mask enables a wide variety of filtering functions with high spectral resolution. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of concept cascaded Raman laser system pumped with a fixed wavelength laser at 1064nm, which can achieve tunable laser output around the first, second and third Stokes components of the 1064 nm pump at 1117 nm, 1175 nm, and 1240 nm.

We achieved wide wavelength tunability of the CRFL by using an in-house built passively Q-switched tunable Yb-doped fiber laser as pump. The Yb-pump is followed by a large-mode area fiber amplifier for pulse-energy scaling and a Raman module for efficient Raman conversion. Subsequently, the NIR CRFL is used as a pump for generating visible light in a second-harmonic generation module, implementing a type-I cut LBO crystal. The CRFL operates at tunable high repetition rate variable from 20kHz to 80kHz. Pulse-duration can also be changed in the range from 40ns to 200ns, by minor modifications. Source is packaged for implementation in a wide range of biomedical imaging applications."

Multiple laser sources are required to target the absorption features of multiple endogenous chromophores (optical absorbers inside tissues). We demonstrate a widely tunable pulsed cascaded Raman fiber laser continuously tunable in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1060–1600 nm) and through harmonic conversion in the visible window (530–600 nm, limited by crystal availability in-house) for PAI in multiple wavelength bands. The laser generates pulse energy ∼10 μJ in the NIR-II window and ∼0.1 μJ in the visible window with a high repetition rate tunable from 20 to 80 kHz and a pulse duration tunable from 40 to 200 ns. The source is then used for PAI, demonstrating photoacoustic spectroscopy of lipids in the second resonance of C–H bonds (1145–1257 nm)."

To eliminate the requirement of precise synchronization and control, we employed a passive Q-switching mechanism for the Yb laser pumping the Raman module. The pump is made continuously tunable in Yb-band with wavelength dependent feedback in the Q-switched cavity ensuring continuous wavelength tunability of generated Raman Stokes. We utilized a large mode-area amplifier to amply pulse-energy without introducing temporal instability and optimized Raman module for efficient pump conversion. We demonstrated a widely tunable visible laser with approximately μJ pulse-energy and approximately 20 − 65kHz repetition-rate, 40-200ns pulse duration. This is the first demonstration of a high pulse energy nanosecond laser continuously tunable in 530nm-600nm making it a versatile laser source for numerous biomedical applications. The wavelength tunable range can be extended to 700nm by utilizing type-II LBO."

Supradeepa, “Brillouin-assisted generation and demultiplexing of widely tunable high-repetition rate 1064 nm optical frequency combs with applications in spectral beam combining,” Optics Express, vol. 33, no. 10, p. 21105, May 2025, doi: 10.1364/oe.560505.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generation and demultiplexing of high-repetition-rate optical frequency combs (OFC) have many applications, including optical metrology, microwave signal generation, and high-resolution spectroscopy. One such novel application is in generating cost-effective seed sources for spectral beam combination (SBC) of multiple fiber laser modules. SBC enables high power-scaling in hundreds of kilowatts, but it requires multiple laser diodes as seed sources, and each source needs its own individual temperature and wavelength stabilization, increasing cost and system complexity. De-multiplexed OFC lines can provide efficient seed sources for SBC, requiring a single laser diode as a seed source. Seed sources at 1 μm are important due to the availability of efficient gain media such as ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers (YDFA). However, due to the lack of components required for generating high-repetition-rate combs(&gt;40 GHz) and high-resolution demultiplexing of OFCs at 1 μm range, such applications are limited. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of tunable high repetition-rate 1 μm OFCs by selective amplification of low-repetition-rate comb lines. Two combs with repetition rates ranging from 9-13 GHz are counter-propagated in a nonlinear Brillouin gain medium. By suitably changing the repetition rates of the combs through selective Brillouin gain due to the Vernier effect, amplified combs with user-defined line spacing of up to 48 GHz were obtained. The spacing could also be tuned in fine steps of 100 MHz or lower. The de-interleaved combs could be demultiplexed using a grating-based demultiplexer. Such sources promise to be a compact replacement for SBC seed sources while also having applications in arbitrary waveform generation and optical metrology."
