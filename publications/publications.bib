  abstract = {Nanosecond pulsed laser sources are widely used in many biomedical imaging applications, including photoacoustic imaging (PAI) \[1\]. Wide wavelength tunability of the source is essential for imaging multiple endogenous chromophores (optical absorbers inside tissues). Pulsed cascaded Raman fiber lasers (CRFL) can provide an efficient method to generate high pulse energy laser sources outside the conventional rare-earth emission bands and their high harmonic bands \[2\]. There were a few demonstrations of PAI using CRFL \[1\]. The CRFLs pumped with a fix wavelength laser source, generated only discrete wavelengths associated with Raman shifts.

  abstract = {The generation and demultiplexing of high-repetition-rate optical frequency combs (OFC) have many applications, including optical metrology, microwave signal generation, and high-resolution spectroscopy. One such novel application is in generating cost-effective seed sources for spectral beam combination (SBC) of multiple fiber laser modules. SBC enables high power-scaling in hundreds of kilowatts, but it requires multiple laser diodes as seed sources, and each source needs its own individual temperature and wavelength stabilization, increasing cost and system complexity. De-multiplexed OFC lines can provide efficient seed sources for SBC, requiring a single laser diode as a seed source. Seed sources at 1 μm are important due to the availability of efficient gain media such as ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers (YDFA). However, due to the lack of components required for generating high-repetition-rate combs(>40 GHz) and high-resolution demultiplexing of OFCs at 1 μm range, such applications are limited. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of tunable high repetition-rate 1 μm OFCs by selective amplification of low-repetition-rate comb lines. Two combs with repetition rates ranging from 9-13 GHz are counter-propagated in a nonlinear Brillouin gain medium. By suitably changing the repetition rates of the combs through selective Brillouin gain due to the Vernier effect, amplified combs with user-defined line spacing of up to 48 GHz were obtained. The spacing could also be tuned in fine steps of 100 MHz or lower. The de-interleaved combs could be demultiplexed using a grating-based demultiplexer. Such sources promise to be a compact replacement for SBC seed sources while also having applications in arbitrary waveform generation and optical metrology.}

Utilizing the temperature dependence of silicon’s absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, wafer temperature can be obtained from the measured transmitted power. Accurate temperature measurements over a wide range require multiple laser sources with different wavelengths, increasing the system’s complexity and reducing acquisition speed, due to the requirement of switching between multiple lasers. The system can be simplified by replacing multiple lasers with a single supercontinuum source. The measurement accuracy in the lower temperature range is poor, using a spectrally flat supercontinuum. We propose the use of a compact, cost-effective telecom fiber-based supercontinuum source whose spectrum can be tailored. We show that spectra having exponential roll-off towards longer wavelengths leads to improvement of the temperature measurement accuracy. We optimized the spectral shape to achieve enhanced measurement accuracy, with ∼1 °C accuracy from room temperature to 600 °C an improvement by a factor of > 6x compared to a flat supercontinuum source. Additionally, the elimination of the need for inline optical switches enhances acquisition speed, which is currently limited only by the detector response time of ∼ 66 ms. The proposed method can easily be scaled for simultaneous temperature measurements at multiple spatial locations, enabled by high power availability from the supercontinuum source.}

By utilizing an electro-optic comb generator that can adjust the repetition rate and central wavelength, this system generates numerous wavelengths from a single laser, serving as individual laser sources for spectral beam combining. Additionally, the system can incorporate a single line-broadener for all channels together for suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). A de-multiplexer is used to separate distinct wavelengths into individual fiber ports. By employing external phase modulation with white noise, the system can adjust the linewidth from a single frequency to 4 GHz. Furthermore, superior SBS control is achieved by tailoring the lineshape in the de-multiplexer, which reduces feedback-assisted SBS. With the customized lineshape, the SBS threshold of the system increases by >50%. By mitigating the complexities of conventional spectral beam combining, such as the use of multiple laser sources and the requirement for each laser to have a current and temperature controller, in addition to a line broadener, this innovative approach presents a cost-effective and less complex alternative for power scaling.}

A wavelength-tunable pump combined with random distributed feedback makes the CRFLs wavelength agile. Broadband point feedback at one end reduces the threshold, leading to multiple cascaded shifts in manageable fiber lengths, generating output in the whole NIR region. Such tunable CRFL can be frequency doubled to obtain a continuously wavelength-tunable visible source. However, the output line widths of such tunable CRFLs are significantly broader than the phase-matching bandwidths of typical nonlinear crystals. Only a small fraction of NIR power is inside the phase-matching bandwidths, leading to poor conversion efficiency. Hence, linewidth reduction of CRFL output is crucial for efficient visible conversion. Using a dual feedback mechanism consisting of an all-wavelength flat plus a desired wavelength narrow feedback, a ∼5× reduction in output linewidths of CRFLs, with multi-watt output powers till six cascaded shifts are obtained without compromising the wavelength tunability of the system. The present work uses a wavelength tunable pump (1055nm to 1095nm) in a dual feedback-based CRFL, providing a linewidth-controlled output in any wavelength in the NIR region. Frequency doubling of the output is carried out to generate continuously tunable visible output from 527nm in green to 710nm in red with powers ∼70mW, with narrow spectral widths (<0.1nm) and single-mode intensity distribution.}

Here, we propose to use a dual feedback mechanism that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths, using a flat cleave, with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength due to a grating filter. This allows substantial linewidth reduction of CRFLs up to the 6th Raman shifts, from 1100 nm to 1500 nm, and can be extended further. Significantly reduced linewidth with multi-watt in-band output power is achieved with fine wavelength tuning within each Raman Stokes band using a fixed wavelength pump.

It has been observed that shorter wavelengths show high absorption at lower temperatures, whereas longer wavelengths show high absorption at elevated temperatures, and vice versa. As a result, for spectra with exponential roll-off towards longer wavelengths, the transmitted power drops sharply as a function of wafer temperature. Hence, higher accuracy of measurement is possible, which is only limited by the intensity noise of the source. The intensity noise of the source is measured as 1.25%.

This is due to transfer of power from the pump to successive Stokes using cascaded Raman conversion. Frequency doubling the output of such widely tunable CRFLs can generate tunable visible lasers from green to red and beyond. But conventional CRFLs have broad linewidths due to the broad Raman gain, which limits the power and efficiency of nonlinear conversion to visible wavelengths. Only a fraction of NIR power is converted to visible, so linewidth control of the generated Stokes is desired. To address this issue, a custom feedback mechanism is used that combines broadband feedback at all wavelengths with filtered feedback at a desired wavelength. This mechanism allows for linewidth control of CRFLs up to the sixth order of Stokes shift and can potentially be extended further till approximately 2 μm, limited by loss and Zero Dispersion Wavelength (ZDWL) in Raman fiber. The result is significantly reduced linewidths from approximately 4-5 nm to <1 nm along with multi-watt class output, as well as fine tuning of wavelength within the Stokes band using a fixed wavelength pump. As proof of concept, over 100 mW of visible power at 557 nm is generated through frequency doubling of the first Stokes along with wavelength tunability.}

  abstract = {Cascaded Raman fiber laser (CRFLs) based on random distributed feedback (RDFB) are proven to be simple, wavelength agile and power scalable technology. However, they are limited in terms of spectral purity where a small amount of output power resides in unwanted Stokes orders. This is due to the inherent intensity noise of pump source used for Raman conversion, which gets transferred and amplified to multiple Stokes orders. Since each Stoke’s signal acts as a pump for the next Stoke’s signal, spectral purity keeps reducing with increasing Stokes order. Further, this increases spectral broadening in these systems due to nonlinear effects of self-phase modulation (SPM) and Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM), thereby, limiting the narrow linewidth operation. Broad spectral width in CRFLs is attributed to 1) inherent broad (~40THz) Raman gain spectrum, and to 2) nonlinear spectral broadening through SPM and XPM. By employing narrow bandwidth spectral filters for feedback and low intensity noise sources for the pump, narrow linewidth operation can be achieved. Here, we demonstrate a low-intensity noise (<-101dBc/Hz from 9kHz to 10GHz) CRFL with <= 99% spectral purity over 6 Stokes orders. A low-intensity noise (<-147dBc/Hz from 9kHz to 10GHz), Narrow linewidth (DBR, 5MHz) 1064nm laser as a pump source. It is line-broadened to ~50GHz bandwidth through phase modulation with a noise source and a sinusoidal signal to suppress stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). It is then amplified to 73W using amplifier chain and a passive Raman fiber of length 340m is used for Raman conversion. This work paves a way to achieve narrow linewidth CRFLs with very high conversion efficiency.}

  abstract = {Raman fiber lasers are an excellent source for achieving high powers in wavelengths conventionally inaccessible with rare-earth-doped fiber lasers. In recent years, wavelength-tunable cascaded Raman lasers have been achieved using a Random Distributed Feedback Raman Fiber laser pumped in the 1micron wavelength band. Here, wavelength tuning is achieved using a combination of output power tuning for selecting different Stokes orders and tuning the wavelength of the pump source for output wavelength tuning around a specific Stokes order. In this approach, the feedback in the laser is broadband, and thus, the spectral purity and spectral linewidth of the output is severely compromised. There have been approaches to control the feedback using different filter architectures such as WDMs, Fabry-Perot filters, filter-fibers. Still, each has limitations in either the operating wavelength window or the spectral resolution. Here, we demonstrate a cascaded Raman laser comprising a reflective Fourier pulse shaper that provides near arbitrary feedback control. Our approach can enable wavelength and linewidth tunable lasers with a fixed wavelength pump. The pulse shaper operates over a wavelength region from 1.1 – 1.3micron, achieves spectral features as small as 0.5nm. The output of the cascaded Raman laser is over 10W, and the center wavelength can be selected from discrete lines at 1117nm, 1175nm, 1240nm with over 15nm of fine-tuning around each. The spectral purity of the output is <95% in all cases. The linewidth of the output is reduced to sub-nm levels and can be continuously tuned from 1-4nm by pulse shaper settings.}

  abstract = {Cascaded Raman Fiber Lasers (CRFL) bridges the gap between conventional fiber lasers emission bands by providing output in the intermediate wavelengths by cascaded Raman stokes conversion. Recently, random distributed feedback (RDFB), which provides broadband feedback, has shown to provide a great amount of wavelength tunability. Currently, coarse tuning in these lasers is achieved by controlling the Raman Stokes order through the power and feedback tuning, while fine-tuning within a Stokes order is achieved using a wavelength-tunable pump laser. Feedback tuning is achieved through simple filters such as short-pass filters to terminate the Raman cascade or a cascade of filters to enhance filtering complexity. In either approach, to achieve wavelength fine-tuning over several Raman Stokes orders, the system complexity is substantially enhanced. Here, we overcome this limitation by using a Fourier spectral shaper, a technique for achieving arbitrary spectral control to modify the feedback. A photolithographically fabricated 2-D mask in the shaper whose spatial co-ordinates can be altered together with the presence of multiple patterns on the mask enables a wide variety of filtering functions with high spectral resolution. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of concept cascaded Raman laser system pumped with a fixed wavelength laser at 1064nm, which can achieve tunable laser output around the first, second and third Stokes components of the 1064 nm pump at 1117 nm, 1175 nm, and 1240 nm. Multiwatt class output powers are demonstrated with a high degree of wavelength conversion of < 95 % in all cases.}
